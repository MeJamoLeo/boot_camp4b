# Road to Green Coder in Atcoder
I don't wanna make a serious plan.
Just a plan for estimation.

## Objection: Practice coding using "Boot camp for Beginners"
https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder/#/training/Boot%20camp%20for%20Beginners

- Easy 100
- Medium 100
- Hard 100 (optional)

When I cannot reach green even if I did Medium 100, I would do Hard 100.

## Current Progressive

Easy 100 (25%)
Medium 100 (0%)

### Easy
- 3 quizes each day
    it will take 25 days.
- 5 quizes each day
    it will take 15 days.
- 10 quizes each day
    it will take 7.25 days.
(These are estimated without revising)

### Medium
- 2 quizes each day
    it will take 50 days.
- 3 quizes each day
    it will take 33 days.
- 5 quizes each day
    it will take 20 days.
- 10 quizes each day
    it will take 10 days.
(These are estimated without revising)


    ```
    3 Easy, and then 2 Midium => 75 days (2.5 month)
    5 Easy, and then 3 Midium => 45 days (1.5 month)
    ```

Today (07/27) ---(75 days later)---> 10/09

TODO: measure how long does 5 quizes take.
